Automata Theory, Algorithm and Codes

# Finite Automata (DFA && NFA)

# Algorithm 1: Convert NFA (epsilon-NFA) to DFA

# Algorithm 2: Thompson's construction algorithm: Construct FA accepts regular language

# Algorithm 3: Minimization DFA (Myhill-Nerode Theorem)

# Algorithm 4: Convert FA to Regular language (Find regular language accepted by FA)

# Grammar (Regular grammar)

# Algorithm 5: Convert Left-linear grammar to Right-linear grammar

# Algorithm 6: Construct NFA from Regular grammar

# Algorithm 7: Convert NFA to Rght-linear grammar

# Algorithm 8: Find regular language generated by Regular grammar
